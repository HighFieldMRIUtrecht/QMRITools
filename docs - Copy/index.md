## Introduction

`QMRITools` is written in Mathematica using Wolfram Workbench and
Eclipse and contains a collection of tools and functions for processing
quantitative MRI data. The toolbox does not provide a GUI and its
primary goal is to allow for fast and batch data processing, and
facilitate development and prototyping of new functions. The core of the
toolbox contains various functions for data manipulation and
restructuring.

The toolbox was developed mostly in the context of quantitative muscle
(Froeling et al.&nbsp;2012), nerve and cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging. The library of functions grows along with the research it is
used for and started as a toolbox to analyze DWI data of muscle. Since
then it has grown to include many other features such as cardiac
analysis (tagging and T1 mapping), dixon reconstruction, EPG modeling
and fitting, j-coupling simulations and more. It currently contains over
350 custom functions (over 20.000 lines of code) complete with
documentation and demonstrations.

</p>

The toolbox is developed for the [Wolfram
language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) and maintained using
[Wolfram workbench](https://www.wolfram.com/workbench/) for
[eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) and runs in the latest version of
[Wolfram Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/).

## Installation

The latest release can be found
[here](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases).

Manual installation:
1.	Download the `QMRITools.zip`.
2.	Extract the `QMRITools` folder and place it in the Mathematica UserBaseDirectory &gt; Applications.

`FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]`

Automatic installation:
1.	Download the `QMRITools-2.3.3.paclet`.
2.	Install the packlet using `PacletInstall`.

`PackletInstall["xxx\\QMRITools-2.3.3.paclet"]`  

Some functions of QMRITools call on external executables and software.
These executables need to be present in &ldquo;QMRITools&rdquo; and are
included in the release. If for any reason you want to use other
(older/newer) versions you can replace them but functionality is not
guaranteed. For the latest version of these tools and their user license
please visit their website.

-   [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/)
    -   dcm2niix.exe
-   [Elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/)
    -   elastix.exe
    -   transformix.exe

All functionality is tested under Windows 10 with the latest Mathematica
version. The Mathematica code is cross platform compatible with the
exception of the external tools which are compiled for each OS. The
toolbox provides compiled versions for each OS but their functionality
is not guaranteed. The Elastix version used is 4.9 with OpenCL support.
Additionally Elastix needs to be compiles with the PCA metrics, all DTI
related parameters and all affine related parameters.

Although cross platform compatibility is provided I have only limited
options for testing so if any issues arise please let me know.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Demonstrations

The release contains a zip file
[DemoAndTest.zip](https://github.com/mfroeling/QMRITools/releases/download/2.0/DemoAndTest.zip)
in which there is a file `demo.nb`, a folder `DemoData` and a folder
`Testing`. To have a global overview of the functionality of the toolbox
you can download this folder and run the `demo.nb`. By default the
`demo.nb` looks for the folders `DemoData` and `Testing` in the same
folder as the notebook.

In the first section of the demo notebook the toolbox is loaded and two
tests are performed. The first test is to check of all files that are
needed to run the toolbox are present. The second test runs after the
toolbox is loaded and checks if all the functions and their options that
are defined are correct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Documentation

Documentation of all functions and their options is fully integrated in
the Mathematica documentation. The toolbox always works within the
latest version of Mathematica and does not support any backward
compatibility. After the toolbox is installed correctly it should show
up as a package in the Mathematica add-ons.

<p align="center">

## Toolboxes

### CardiacTools

A collection of tools to analyze cardiac data. The main features are
cardiac shape analysis which allows defining the hard in a local
myocardial coordinate system which allows quantifying and analyzing
data. When the cardiac geometry is known there are functions to analyze
qMRI parameters in the AH17 model (Cerqueira et al. 2002) or perform
transmural sampling of qMRI parameters. Most of the functionality is
demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

![Cardiac segmentation in the AHA-17 model and estimation of the local
myocardial coordinate
stystem.](\QMRITools\images\cardiac.png)

### CoilTools

A collection of tools to evaluate complex multi-coil data. The functions
are specific for analysis of multi-coil magnitude and noise data which
allows quantifying per channel SNR. Furthermore, if complex coil
sensitivity maps are available it allows performing SENSE g-factor maps
simulations.  
This toolbox is not demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### DenoiseTools

The toobox provides two algorithms that allow denoising of DWI data. The
first is based on and LMMSE framework (Aja-Fernandez et al. 2008) and
the second is based on a random matrix theory and Principal component
analysis framework (Veraart, Fieremans, and Novikov 2016; Veraart et al.
2016). Furthermore, it provides an anisotropic filter for denoising the
estimated diffusion tensor which provides more reliable fiber
orientation analysis (Lee, Chung, and Alexander 2006). Most of the
functionality is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### DixonTools

An IDEAL based Dixon reconstruction algorithm (Reeder et al. 2005; Yu et
al. 2008). The method provides multi-peak fitting B0 field and T2-
correction. The toolbox also provides a function for unwrapping phase
data in 2D and 3D based on a best path method (Abdul-Rahman et al. 2007;
Herraez et al. 2002). It also contains a function that allows simulating
gradient echo Dixon data. Most of the functionality is demonstrated in
the `demo.nb`.

![IDEAL based Dixon reconstruction: fitted fat fractions as a function
of the imposed fat fraction, SNR and B0 field
offset.](\QMRITools\images\dixon.png)

### ElastixTools

A wrapper that calls the Elastix registration framework (Klein et al.
2010; Shamonin 2013). The toolbox determines what registration or
transformations need to be performed, exports the related data to a temp
folder and calls an automatically generated command line script that
performs the registration. After registration is completed the data is
again loaded into Mathematica. Most of the functionality is demonstrated
in the `demo.nb`.

### GeneralTools

This toolbox provides core functions used in many other functions and
features. The functions comprise amongst others: data cropping,
mathematical and statistical operators that ignore zero values, and data
rescaling, transformation and padding. Most of the functionality is
demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### GradientTools

The main feature is an algorithm that uses static repulsion (Jones,
Horsfield, and Simmons 1999; Froeling et al. 2017) to generate
homogeneously distributed gradient directions for DWI experiments. It
also provides functions to convert bval and bvec files to bmatrix and
vice versa. Most of the functionality is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

![The graphical user interface of the gradient generation
tool.](\QMRITools\images\gradients-2.png)

### ImportTools

Allows importing DCM data or DCM header attributes. These functions are
rarely used since the toolbox mostly uses the NIfTY data format and
provides tools to convert DCM to NIfTI via
[dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix). This toolbox is not
demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### IVIMTools

The toolbox includes functions to perform IVIM fitting of DWI data.
There are two main functions: non linear fitting and Bayesian fitting
(Orton et al. 2014). Some of the functionality is demonstrated in the
`demo.nb`.

<p align="center">
<img src="\QMRITools\images\ivim.png" alt="Visualization of IVIM fitting."  width="70%" />
</p>

### JcouplingTools

A toolbox that allows simulation of NMR spectra using Hamiltonians based
on methods from [FID-A](https://github.com/CIC-methods/FID-A). It allows
simulating large spin systems (Castillo, Patiny, and Wist 2011) and was
mainly implemented to investigate fat spectra in TSE (Stokes et al.
2013). Most of the functionality is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### MaskingTools

Tools for masking and homogenization of data. It provides functions for
smoothing cutting and merging masks and functions for the evaluation of
data within masks. Most of the functionality is demonstrated in the
`demo.nb`.

### NiftiTools

Import and export of the NIfTI file format. Part of the code is based on
previously implemented
[nii-converter](https://github.com/tomdelahaije/nifti-converter). For
converting DICOM data to the NIfTI file format the toolbox uses
[dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases). It also
provides some specialized NIfTI import functions for specific
experiments which are probably not generalizable. Most of the
functionality is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### PhysiologyTools

Functions for importing and analyzing Philips physiology logging and
RespirAct trace files. The functions are rarely used and not well
supported. This toolbox is not demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### PlottingTools

A variety of functions for visualization of various data types. The main
functions are &lsquo;PlotData&rsquo; and &lsquo;PlotData3D&rsquo; which
allow viewing 2D, 3D and 4D data. Most of the functionality is
demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### Reconstruction Tools

A variety of function for raw MRI data reconstruction. The main goal was to 
create a set of functions that allow for the reconstruction of multi coil 3D CSI 
data and and low SNR 31P imaging data. For this toolbox there is no demo.  

### ProcessingTools

The toolbox comprises a variety of functions that allow data
manipulation and analysis. The main functions allow joining multiple
data sets into one continuous data set (Froeling et al. 2015) or to
split data of two legs into two separate data-sets. Furthermore, it
contains a collection of functions for data evaluation and analysis.
Most of the functionality is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### RelaxometryTools

A collection of tools to fit T2, T2\*, T1rho and T1 relaxometry data.
The main function of this toolbox is an extended phase graph (EPG)
(Weigel 2015) method for multi-compartment T2 fitting of multi-echo spin
echo data (Marty et al. 2016). Therefore it provides functions to
simulate and evaluate EPG. Some of the functionality is demonstrated in
the `demo.nb`.

![Demonstration of EPG based T2 fitting: the fitted water T2 relaxation
as a function of B1, SNR and fat
fraction.](\QMRITools\images\epg-t2.png)

### SimulationTools

The main purpose of this toolbox is to simulate DTI based DWI data and
contains some functions to easily perform analysis of the fit results of
the simulated signals (Froeling et al. 2013). Some of the functionality
is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

### SpectroTools

The main purpose of this toolbox is to process and visualize spectra data
and allows to fit spectra using simulated basis spectra. Some of the functionality
is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

![Resulting basis spectra of a fit of 31P spectra of muacle.](\QMRITools\images\spectra_fit.jpg)

### TensorTools

The original toolbox where the project started. The main functions in
this toolbox are to fit and evaluate the diffusion tensor model. Various
fitting methods are implemented (e.g.&nbsp;LLS, NLS, WLLS, and iWLLS).
The default method is an iterative weighted linear least squares
approach (Veraart et al. 2013). The tensor fitting also includes outlier
detections using REKINDLE (Tax et al. 2015) and data preparation
includes drift correction (Vos et al. 2017). Most of the functionality
is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.

![MD and FA as a function of SNR and fat fraction. Results are from
simulated data using an iWLLS algorithm with outlier
rejection.](\QMRITools\images\dti.png)

### VisteTools

Import and export functions for tensor data which can be used in the
[vIST/e](https://sourceforge.net/projects/viste/) tractography tool. None
of the functionality is demonstrated in the `demo.nb`.
